# QRS-Detection
DSP Based QRS Detection Using Pan-Tompkins Algorithm

Developed a DSP-based QRS detection system using the Pan-Tompkins algorithm, implemented offline on the TMS320C6748 hardware platform. This solution enables efficient and accurate ECG signal processing for cardiac event detection.  

DSP : TMS320C6748
